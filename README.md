After installing MySQL please open the MySQL Workbench and open your local MySQL Server and create a new Schema <br/>

You can simply right click on the Schema navigator on the left and click on create Schema with the name as "foodapp" or whichever you feel is best (Remember to use the same name in the .env file).<br/> After creating the new schema run the following query:

`ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';`
Where root as your user, localhost as your URL, and password as your password
After running the query successfully, run the following query:
`flush privileges`;
